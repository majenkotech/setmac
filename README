Set eth0's MAC address from uBoot's NVRAM
=========================================

This little utility will query the key `ethaddr` in uBoot's
NVRAM segment and configure `eth0`'s MAC address accordingly.

It is intended to run at startup using the included systemd service.

Usage
-----

In uBoot set your desired MAC address:

    setenv ethaddr de:ad:be:ef:fe:ed
    saveenv

In Linux ensure the service is enabled:

    systemctl enable setmac

Reboot and marvel at your new MAC address.
